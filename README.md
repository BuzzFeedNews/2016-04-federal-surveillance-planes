# Government Surveillance Planes Analysis

This repository contains data and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code to support the findings reported in the April 6, 2016 BuzzFeed News article "[Spies In The Skies](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/spies-in-the-skies)."

## Data

The data comes from more than four months of plane tracking data provided by the wesbite [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/), plus the Federal Aviation Administration's [aircraft registration database](http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download/).

## Methodology / Code / Findings

A detailed methodology, the code running it, and the results it produces can be found online [here](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2016-04-federal-surveillance-planes/analysis.html), and in the R Markdown document `analysis.Rmd`.
